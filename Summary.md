 # RoboAdvisor

 In  this assignment I  was hired  as a digital transformation consultant to buid a RoboAdviser (robo advisor)  that could be used by customers or potential new customers to get investment portfolio recommendations for retirement from one of the most prominent retirement plan providers in the country.


The Robo  was succesfully built, tested and validated using Amazon Lex and Lambda functions. 

# Show case in GitHub
To show case of  my  work - I  have provided copy of  my  bot, intent, and slot using Amazon Lex zip file. I also provided here a  short version of screen recording  of how the Robo is responding in Amazon Lex test envirroment  mode.  I have also provided  a python script with my  final lambda function for review.
